# hubot-cantchart

Are you tired of your management team and co-workers having expectations about your work? We've experienced dozens or hundreds of reasons over the years that work can't be done -- even when critical. To show how you can't get any work done, you just put yourself on the can't chart. 

This is extension pulls for the wisdom of the crowd on [websages/hates-software/issues/1](https://github.com/websages/hates-software/issues/1), which is pertty much just perfect.
